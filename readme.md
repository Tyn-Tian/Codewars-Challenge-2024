# Codewars Challenge 2024 n/365

## Description

A challenge that i will undertake in 2024 to strengthen my JavaScript language and also hone my programming logic.

## Question and others

### 3. Return Negative

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

**Examples**

```javascript
makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
```

**Notes**

- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

### 4. Sum of positive

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example **[1,-4,7,12]** => **1 + 7 + 12 = 20**

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

### 7. Convert a Number to a String!

We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

**Examples (input --> output)**
```javascript
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"
```
