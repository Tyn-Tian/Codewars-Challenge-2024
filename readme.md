### 3. Return Negative

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

**Examples**

```javascript
makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
```

**Notes**

- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

### 4. Sum of positive

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example **[1,-4,7,12]** => **1 + 7 + 12 = 20**

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.
