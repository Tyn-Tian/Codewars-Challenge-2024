# Codewars Challenge 2024 n/365

## Description

A challenge that i will undertake in 2024 to strengthen my JavaScript language and also hone my programming logic.

## Question and others

### 1. Even or Odd

Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and return **"Even"** for even numbers or **"Odd"** for odd numbers.

### 3. Return Negative

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

**Examples**

```javascript
makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
```

**Notes**

- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

### 4. Sum of positive

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example **[1,-4,7,12]** => **1 + 7 + 12 = 20**

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

### 5. Reversed Strings

Completed the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

```javascript
'world' => 'dlrow'
'word' => 'drow'
```

### 6. Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'

Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a **"Yes"** string for **true**, or a **"No"** string for **false**.

### 7. Convert a Number to a String!

We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

**Examples (input --> output)**

```javascript
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"
```

### 8. Vowel Count

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider **a**,**e**,**i**,**o**,**u** as vowels for this Kata (but not **y**).
The input will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

### 9. Disemvowel Trolls

Troll are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata **y** isn't considered a vowel.

### 10. Square Every Digit

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9^2 is 81 and 1^2 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 7^2 is 49, 6^2 is 36, and 5^2 is 25. (49-36-25)

**Note**: The function accepts an integer and return an integer.

Happy Coding!

### 11. Highest and Lowest

In this little assignment you are given a string of spacec separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

**Examples**

```javascript
higAndLow("1 2 3 4 5"); // return "5 1"
higAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
higAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
```

**Notes**

- All numebers are valid **Int32**, no need to validate them.
- There will always be at least one number in the input string.
- Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

### 12. Descending Order

You task is to make a function that can take non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

**Examples:**
Input: **42145** Output: **54421**
Input: **145263** Output: **654321**
Input: **123456789** Output: **987654321**
